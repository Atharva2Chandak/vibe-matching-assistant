# üåü Vibe Mapping Shopping Assistant

A conversational AI shopping assistant that recommends fashion products based on customer's style "vibes" and preferences.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands style "vibes" like "casual", "elevated", "flowy" and converts them to concrete product attributes
- **Smart Recommendations**: Provides tailored product recommendations based on user preferences
- **Conversational UI**: Chat-based interface that feels natural and engaging
- **Personalized Justifications**: Explains why products were recommended in a human-like way using Gemini API
- **Smart Follow-up Questions**: Dynamically generates contextual questions to gather missing information

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: Powers the interactive web interface
- **Pandas**: Handles product catalog data processing
- **Google Gemini AI**: Generates personalized responses and follow-up questions
- **Python-dotenv**: Manages API keys and environment variables

## üíª Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure your environment variables in `.env` file (for sake of your convenience, I have temporarily added my own API key directly, which however is not a good practice):
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run pp.py
   ```

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage

The shopping assistant will:
1. Ask about your style preferences in a conversational manner
2. Request any missing critical information about size, budget, etc.
3. Display product recommendations that match your style "vibes"
4. Explain why each product was recommended

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- *Flexible Matching Rules*:  The vibe mapping algorithm may sometimes produce imperfect matches as style interpretation is subjective. Rules are intentionally not rigid to ensure at least some product recommendations appear for most queries
- *Conversation Reset Needed*: Added a "Start Afresh" button to reset the conversation flow when starting a new query as the assistant may sometimes struggle to distinguish between follow-up questions and new queries without explicit indication
- *Style Vocabulary*: Limited vocabulary for certain niche fashion styles which may require further training
